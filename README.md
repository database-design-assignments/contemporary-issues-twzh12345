# Open data advantages and disadvantages
In this document, I will discuss two issue with Open data and the solutions for them.
## article 1
In Scott Gilbertson's [Open Data's Access Problem, and How to Solve it](https://www.wired.com/2010/09/open-datas-access-problem-and-how-to-solve-it/), he talks about the problem that it seems like a good thing that give everyone the access to the data, but upper classes and corporations will try to use it to exploit from the unknowing poor. He give two example of it - Bangalore and Nova Scotia, and list 4 solutions to it:
> * Advocacy: the data should be used by community to benefit everyone
> * Internet access: enable some of the rural areas do have access to teh data, otherwise, it is not open data.
> * Content and formatting: make sure the data being easy to be understood otherwise it will be used by some elite to exploit people
> * Computer/software skills: similar to content and formatting, the ordinary people do not know how to use it. It might need to consider develop some easy handle tools for people to use.

This is the summary of this article.

## article 2
In Tony Roberts' [The problem with Open Data](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/The-problem-with-Open-Data), he talks about the problem that, the raw data might be unable to be used in anyway by ordinary people. Then he provide two solutions for this.
> * data need to be make easy to use
> * public awareness need to be raised to enable communities to apply data.

This is the summary of this article.

## Summary
Open data is a good thing, however, if we only provide raw data, it will lead to two problem ordinary people cannot use it and upperclass will take advantages of it and to exploit ordinary people, thus we need to be careful about it.
